The vegatarian lasagna was a true succes, would order again ! Both dishes looked and smelled amazing, too bad i don't like bitter food. ",

Fast delivery, very fresh food and almost no wrapping involved. I could very tell this person was passionate about cooking :).",

I've ordered it here, and it almost felt like i was back at grandma's. I know it is supposed to be JuSt FoOd, but for me this was a great experience. The nostalgia hit me. I recommend this Cook to everybody who loves some good old Vlaamse Kost ! ",

On top of that, you'll feel at home as they go the extra mile to make sure you're enjoying the evening. The expert knowledge of wine and, especially, beers is a definite bonus we won't forget. The fact that it was pouring was long forgotten.",
